If you are having difficulties finding data, given that our course my be your first fintech class, I will loosen the requirements for your paper. You DO NOT need to produce results, and I will allow you to:

1. Simply choose a topic that you may be interested in, such as consumer behvarior, transaction, etc.

2. If you can find some data and generate training results, that is great. If you can't, you can craft your presentation/ presentation to answer the (not limited to) following questions:

- Why you want to target this area

- What kind of data would you use, if available

- What kind of things you want to predict

- How you plan to use the result (how does it contribute to the area)

3. Present the topic and your potential plan in your presentation and your paper

I will discuss more in class. Thank you.
